This SCOTUS case is for universities), to try to improve the diversity of their admissions programs. It is well known that minorities like Black people or hispanic people are underrepresented in terms of college. admissions/enrollment/completion. Universities have tried to address this directly. This can be tricky, because some of the factors that go into it aren't controlled by universities- it's not just that their admissions offices are biased, but also things like systemic racism in broader society. So if universities want to not ignore that disparity, they need to find a way to adjust for that, since they can't fix society by themselves. Otherwise you end up with a skewed admissions pool.\\n\\nUnder affirmative action, the university can consider an applicants race/background as a part of the application. These days, most universities use a hol...\n","2      Answer: The article you provided has a lot of this info.\\n\\n**What is affirmative action?**\\n\\nIn the broadest sense, affirmative action is any policy intended to end and/or correct the effects of discrimination.  However, when people talk about affirmative action, they're generally referring to one particular type of affirmative action: Race-conscious school admissions.  This is when a college (or other program) intentionally tries to increase the racial diversity of its student body by accepting more applicants who are part of races underrepresented on campus.  \\n\\n**Which side is for/against it?  Who are the biggest proponents?**\\n\\nIn this Supreme Court case, Harvard and UNC (2 universities) are supporting affirmative action while an organization representing some students is opposing it.  In general, support for affirmative action is more common among liberals/Democrats who contend that it helps counter historical injustices and provides more opportunities to students at a dis...\n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Asian students really threw a bone into AA. \\n\\nIf African American students are under represented, then Asian students are over represented. Thats a very tough angle when looking at admissions criteria that include race. \\n\\nShould Asian students have a higher requirement for college because of over representation?\n","4      Another quick example of a problem AA can create while having very good intentions- say there’s a regional manager position opening up soon at a fortune 500 corporation because someones retiring, and 7 different workers underneath that position are all competing to fill that role. The competition is going well and 3 contestants are absolutely standing out with stellar performance on tasks related to the new role, with two contestants just generally giving a tad more effort without getting recognized and two others literally putting in no extra effort and are just kind of not actually caring if they get it. Obviously the top 3 performers are going to be selected as candidates to rise up to the new position, but unbeknownst to any of them the corporations PR teams have been pushing an affirmative action mandated claim- that 15% or more of their regional managers are race Y instead of having a fully race X leadership. \\n\\nIn the case of our specific manager position opening up, two of...\n","...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ...\n","47199                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thanks - I added an excerpt from that article to the post above.\n","47200                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      LOL I'm just stating and posting an article and I'm getting downvoted!

This SCOTUS case is for universities), to try to improve the diversity of their admissions programs. It is well known that minorities like Black people or hispanic people are underrepresented in terms of college. admissions/enrollment/completion. Universities have tried to address this directly. This can be tricky, because some of the factors that go into it aren't controlled by universities- it's not just that their admissions offices are biased, but also things like systemic racism in broader society. So if universities want to not ignore that disparity, they need to find a way to adjust for that, since they can't fix society by themselves.

I view it as a calculated political move by his campaign...either he doesn’t care and we/Natives are not worth his time &amp;/or it would expose him to potentially incoherently bumbling through it with video evidence.\\n\\nLike a skilled politician/political parasite, I think that Biden takes a lot of credit for things that others actually did.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>47204 rows × 1 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-28da841b-b425-44ee-9433-ad7afa3913cd')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-28da841b-b425-44ee-9433-ad7afa3913cd button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Just because your DNA test showed your genetic make up consists of genetic material more often seen within Indian populations, does not make you Native. But, like others have said, if you do your research and find out you're from the Yaqui nation or another nation, inquire about citizenship and find ways to actually be involved with that nation's culture. I'm tired of box-checkers taking advantage of what few benefits we do have, without actually giving back to the community they claim to be a part of, which is the whole idea behind affirmative action in the first place! \\n\\nI'm glad you took the time to ask ...\n","5   I see this is an old post but I came across it from my research into this very topic. My DNA results are 27.3% Indigenous American. Here's the thing, I WANT to learn about that part of my ancestry. But all I can find is gatekeeping left and right. \\n\\nI get it, you don't want people to get the \"small\" benefits you get. Fine, cool even. But telling people they are not Native Indian when their DNA says differently seems like gatekeeping to me. Here's why. \\n\\nMy whole life I have been told I'm Mexican and Irish. Had no idea I have very little Mexican blood. Now here's the rub. This has opened a door to me that I wouldn't even consider opening otherwise. Meaning I want to learn about that part of my genetic makeup. I want to learn about what tribe my ancestors belonged to, learn more about what they have gone through, their beliefs, their lifestyle. To me, these are all things that should be welcomed with open arms.

So I won't get into any further debates. About me being racist, I should point out that racism also has a component of power that I as a brown-skinned Indian from a very poor tribe that is struggling for its very survival absolutely lack. About population statistics, check out your own facts in your own white sources on wikipedia and you will learn Cherokee pop (299,862) > Navajo pop (173,987). In any event, your ad hominen attacks on me are pointless. Focus on substantive issues like what your white Cherokee Nation is doing that cause almost all other Indian tribes to hate them or why you get laughed at at any powwow.\n","16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          8 years later & all my Oglala folks are still shitting on Cherokees.

It is middle-class BIPOC students who benefit the policy. If the goal is to reduce to 'racial' wealth gap, then affirmation action is failing spectacularly.\\n\\nRaising the minimum wage, access to housing and Healthcare are the best ways to increase. Affirmation action actively hurts BIPOC communities due to loss of self-esteem and is deeply unpopular with non-student American Indians, Hispanics, Black's, and 'conservative' white-people. It is only popular with students who wrongly believe it will help them, and liberal white people.\\n\\nWhat we can say, is that it is deeply racist to oppose access to Healthcare, housing, and increasing the minimum wage.

I went to a PWI, with very few black students. Like way less than 10%. I only went because of the scholarship they offered.

So if a kid had your same entry grade but you are rich with a fancy sounding name and this kid is names Maikol Jacson Perez and lives in some sketchy area in Limon, guess who is geting the spot? \\n\\nThis is good, and unfair at the same time. \\nMy brother had to try twice to enter el Tecnologico de Cr.

At the time, I was working in a factory with mostly Brazilians from all over Brazil (some where Japanese descendants them selfs and the rest were married to one - in order to be able to live in Japan). So, it was awhile after 9/11 and the US was about to invade Iraq. Ever since 9/11, this loira (blonde, probably from the south) Brazilian would make remarks here and there how the US deserved what happened. I ignored them. I had friends who kept on telling her how rude that was. But, one day she just kept on and said Americans deserved to die that day (I pointed out it wasn’t all Americans). And, that Americans are awful, horrible people who deserve all the bad that comes to them. I then asked if I was that bad?

In NYC, me and my family were waiting to be seated at lobster house and my mom was standing near the door. Two big dudes entered the restaurant and accidently bumped into her. They told her to move to the side and because my mom doesn't speak english well, asked me what they had said in spanish. Once they heard her speaking spanish one of them said \"fucking latinos, learn to speak english\" and left. I was 16 and afraid to speak up. I ended up not telling my mom what they had said because I didn't want her to get upset.\\n2. A drunk guy in a train from Warsaw to Krakow started pointing at me and screaming that I'm chinese.

I was the only white guy playing there, the other ones had the physical appearance of native Peruvians. It was a big park and I could see at least 3 or 4 other families/groups(white or mostly white) playing football too.

Little by little, everyone on the team realices that we are being film so one of my friends go asks her “is there something you need or anything you want?” Then the lady starts yelling at us how we are destroying the flowers, the grass and that we shouldn’t be there ...\n","70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       My case has been that bad, but I look Northen European, so people asume I'm a rich prick because rich ppl in my country are white arseholes, but I'm actually poor.\n","71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I was travelling the south of the US with my sister, when i asked a mid 30's lady where the nearest ATM was and she said \"you are from brooklyn, what are you doing in here (Atlanta)?\" to which i responded with \"i am from South America\" and she said straight to my face that \"she could use a new gardener\".\n","72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               No, I'm white lol \\n\\nThough received a lot of bullying in school because of my curly hair.\n","73                                                                I’m white-passing for the most part, & have been called derogatory words for “looking Jewish” or even “Middle Eastern”, but my mestiza mom who is mostly indigenous has been called “sp!c” before & the only other time was when an older, white/white-passing Cuban pathetically attempted to call her “india” derogatorily (a lot of older white/white-passing Cubans where I live in the US are well-known to be racist even against other Latinos/Hispanics, & especially/ironically black people, even black & mixed Cubans).

I haven't faced any racism in Canada, but I asked my father about his story and he had many interesting things to say. He hasn't felt any racism in Canada either, But in the US, he felt the most racism in Miami... from other Latinos. People thought they could take advantage of him because he was a recent immigrant who didn't know English. First, some Argentineans refused to speak to him at all and ignored him every time he spoke, so he quit that job right away.\\r Later a Colombian woman was racist to him when he was working for her at a Walgreens, he had stocked some things wrong and the woman came and knocked all his work down and said some mean things. Also, some Cubans and Puerto Ricans there gave him no sense of hospitality, he'd say \"Hello, how are you?\" to them at his job and they'd say things like \"Just tell me what you want, papo\". I don't even know what that means. Later when he moved to Virginia it was better because the Salvadorians there were so...\n","78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Being from the US it’s crazy to imagine not seeing racism daily. I grew up in the South (Alabama) and I’m fortunate to be white— what they consider white; I know Latinos come in many races— but my friends who were Black or Latino dealt with so much bad stuff even from teachers at school. My family was so racist they always used slurs and complained about non-white people and wouldn’t let me hang up posters of POC or god forbid date them.

I lived in the US for a while, and when I was in High School, there was his redhead girl who only had white friends. Now, at this point, I was already fluent in English, so you pretty much assume my English was understandable, since I had a lot of non-Hispanic friends.\\n\\nWell, I asked this girl something related to a class, and she pretended she couldn't understand my English. Someone even told her what I was saying, but she kept pretending. This happened twice... with the same girl. I saw her doing the same to some Hispanic classmates as well. You'd only see her speaking with white people, really.\\n\\nAlso, when I go back shopping or seeing family, some people just assume I don't speak English, and speak to me in Spanish, but that doesn't come nearly as rude or offensive, since most of the time, they are fellow Hispanics or Mexicans who are also fluent in Spanish, so I'd not consider it racist in nature, just... funny, curious.\n","94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      nope\n","95                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     not that I noticed. though a few months ago my mom actually told me that when my brother and I were kids, we had this one school friend that we had to stop seeing because his parents said they didn't want him hanging around us Latinos and my parents decided they didn't want us around that racist family lol\\n\\nthis was in Canada btw, but luckily nothing else besides that!\n","96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Not personally, unless you take racism/colorism at literal value, in which case I was considered \"too dark\" by my mom's side of the family.

Later he found his smartphone hidden under his messy backpack. Also common was my friend who had a black power being mistaken for a pot dealer.\n","97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yes, I've been turned down for job interviews and positions because of my skin color.\n","98                                                                                                                                                       I'm European, but this hapened in Latin America. I was in a bus, in Dominican Republic, not that far from the border with Haiti (had not been there). The military stopped us. They asked the «morenos» to leave the bus (this is, the black people, suspect of being Haitian). Then, they saw me and said «el rubio también» (the blond one too). My Spanish is quite good, but not Dominican Spanish, so I didn't understand they were talking about me, because my hair is black. It seems «rubio» does not mean blonde but white. Other bus passengers had to tell me they were talking about me. So well, all non Dominicans were out of the bus. They made me open all my bags and take out everything and show them. Had to wait on the military post till the next bus a couple hours. Everything, at least at the begining, with one soldier pointing a machine gun to me.\n","99                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Racism?

I got fed up with taking it silently out of politeness so I began to answer her cuttingly, matching her energy, and she got upset.\\n\\nI also caught several lies she was making up about having been very familiar with the US (like saying she saw the Lincoln Monument in Florida, wtf).\n","130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Yes, as a person of African decent you just kind of learn to deal with prejudice as you'll experience it in many different places from many different types of people.

Idk what it’s like on the East Coast but at least in the West Coast people are becoming more and more open with their disdain for minorities from what I and my family & friends have experienced. A lot of conservative people found their voices bc of Trump & Canada grants citizenship to quite a lot of immigrants that “cause housing prices to increase + stealing our jobs”. Then again I’m drawing conclusions from my experiences as an East Asian person, so I’ve gotten a lot more openly hostile verbal aggressions and physical aggressions than maybe some other m...\n","207

From my mother side, Portuguese (?) and African roots.\\n\\nMy grandfather was very black, and he didn't like to tell his story much.

Which is a shame, you would think they'd be natural allies.\n","239  Being dumb is a people problem, not a (insert nation) peope problem.\\n\\nPeople are getting to know more things (for example, if I asked an average person 200 years ago for the fórmula resolvente which I don't know how to name in english he'd look at me like an alien, now everyone remembers it) but every so often I notice that critical thinking issues are becoming more and more difficult to solve for people. If I asked an 18yo in 1990 how to assemble a computer, odds are he'd have no idea, but now everyone and their mother knows (to be fair it's easier, but still it is quite a step forward). But people only know it because they read and/or were given instructions, not because they understand how it works.\\n\\nI did some testing for the govt. and kids are definitely lacking in critical thinking skills (interpretation of basic text, directives, and tasks were frustrating due to reasons I can not disclose).\\n\\nEducation has become an implantation of instructions to follow and knowledge ...\n","240                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     lol.\n","241                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ohh I get it! but I can't promise you I won't stop to look at times square buildings XD\n","242                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               HAHAHAHAHA desculpa, mas eu ri imaginando a cena.

everyone speaks English”.\\n\\nThat perhaps gives a bit of insight in why people dont like anglo americans much, haha , particularly other americans from countries like peru or brazil , who usually expect a bit more of friendliness and opening to learning a language in a new place.\\n\\nStill , people get real vindictive and resentfull some times, i recomend you take them as outliers , as to why

Brazil is famous for having a inmense middle eastern comunity that has fled there for better oportunities.Perhaps her family has sufered at the hands of us interventions , and coupled with some unsavory interactions with other anglo americans , perhaps thats what , in her mind , justifies it?\\n\\nSome people really lets hate go to their brains , best to just sides step it , not something we can change...\n","258                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Lol Neymar would be like one of those friends you call negro here\n","259                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wait...Who would think Neymar is white?

So any of them that are lighter skin will consider themselves white , when they are in fact mulato, mestizo or mixed , definitely not white .  The skin color is not the only factor in determining one’s race and that in it self is not enough . Facial characteristics, hair etc.. a dna test breaks it down the best . There are a lot of companies out there.

Most of parents/grandparents of contemporary Afro-Brazilians were (strictu sensu) illiterate, because past governments simply didn't care. The literacy situation has started to change after the military dictatorship, and policies to include blacks in environments such as Universities were first implemented in mid-2000s, thus **this is super recent**.\\n\\n>When I have meetings with Brazilian partners/customers I'm usually the only black person and technically I'm not even black. I met a black guy (very hot btw), but he was also really mixed.\\n\\nMost Brazilian blacks (in an US definition, i.e., what is usually called \"negros\") are mixed (pardos), actually.
