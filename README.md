# URV_Sentiment_Analysis
URV Summer 2023 - Reddit Sentiment Analysis Project

This is a Sentiment Analysis Project investigating Reddit activity in order to gain insights on how 
attitudes toward affirmative action differ based on ethnic group. 

- It utilized the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW), Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, NLTK, and wordcloud
- After scraping over 1000 submissions from over 30 subreddits and over 50000 comments, the text data were processed and curated in order to stratify sentiments by ethnic group. Eventually, the stratified data were used to generate polarity scores, which were eventually visualized in the form of word clouds as well as pie graphs.
- Methodology and final results are outlined and summarized in the final poster included above
